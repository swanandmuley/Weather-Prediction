# Weather App

This Python script allows you to get the current weather of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It retrieves weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and description of the weather conditions.

## Features

- Get current weather data for a city.
- Displays temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description.
- Simple and easy-to-understand output.
- Supports metric units for temperature (°C).

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need:
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. **Requests library** to make HTTP requests.

You can install the required library using `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests
```

3. **OpenWeatherMap API key**: You need an API key to access OpenWeatherMap's weather data. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get your free API key.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the script in a text editor or IDE.
3. Replace `'your_api_key_here'` in the script with your **OpenWeatherMap API key**.
4. Run the script.

```bash
python weather_app.py
```

5. The program will prompt you to enter a city name.
6. Type the name of the city you want the weather for, and press Enter.
   
   Example input: `London`
   
7. The script will display the following weather data:
   - Temperature (in Celsius)
   - Atmospheric pressure (in hPa)
   - Humidity (in percentage)
   - Weather description (e.g., clear sky, cloudy, etc.)

## Example Output

If you input "London," you might get the following output:

```
Enter city name: London
Temperature: 15°C
Pressure: 1012 hPa
Humidity: 82%
Weather description: clear sky
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the city is not found, the script will output: `"City not found."`
- Make sure you enter a valid city name and that your internet connection is stable.
- If the API limit is exceeded or there is an issue with the OpenWeatherMap API, the script may return an error message.
